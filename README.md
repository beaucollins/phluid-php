#Phluid

A microframework for PHP. Quite heavily inspired by [Express][]. [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/beaucollins/phluid-php.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beaucollins/phluid-php)

Built on top of [ReactPHP](https://github.com/reactphp/react).

[Express]: http://expressjs.com "Express web application framework for node"

## Install

[Composer][] sample `composer.json`

    {
      "name" : "beaucollins/sample-app",
      "require" : {
        "phluid/phluid":"master-dev"
      }
    }

[Composer]: http://getcomposer.org "Composer: PHP dependency manager"

## Example

Add Phluid to your `composer.json` and `$> composer install`. Throw this into `server.php`:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
    
$app = new Phluid\App();

// add some handlers

$app->get( '/', function( $request, $response ){
  $response->renderText( 'Hello World' );
});

$app->get( '/hello/:name', function( $request, $response ){
  $response->renderText( "Hello {$request->param('name')}");
});

$app->listen( 4000 );
```
    
Then boot up your server from the command line:

    $> php server.php
  
Open [http://localhost:4000/][example] in your browser.

## Middleware

Any invocable PHP object can be used as a middleware. It receives three
arguments: `$request`, `$response`, and `$next`. If the middleware decides it
doesn't need to handle the request it can simply call `$next()`.

```php
// You can use a "closure"
$app->inject( function( $request, $response, $next ){
  if( 0 === strpos( $request->path, '/admin/' ) ){
    $response->redirectTo( '/login' );
  } else {
    $next();
  }
});

// You can use a string that contains the name of a function
function server_header( $request, $response, $next ){
  $response->setHeader( 'X-Served-By', 'Phluid' );
  $next();
};
$app->inject( 'server_header' );

// Any callable works, so you use an object if you like
$warden = new Warden();
$app->inject( array( $warden, 'protect' ) );
// calls $warden->protect( $request, $response, $next )
```

There are quite a few middlewares provided already:

- BasicAuth: add's support for HTTP Basic Auth header parsing
- Cascade: Chain middleware together
- ExceptionHandler: Renders a stack trace error page for debugging
- FormBodyParser: Parses form encoded request bodies
- JsonBodyParser: Parses JSON request bodies
- MultipartBodyParser: Parses multipart requests
- Prefix: Mounts middleware under a prefix 
- RequestTimer: Records time for the full request/response cycle
- StaticFiles: Serves static files from a specified folder
- Cookies: Parsing cookie request header and sending set-cookie response headers
- Sessions: Stateful data based on a session id cookie, pluggable session storage mechanism
- Cache: Implements `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` conditional GET requests


### Configurations

It may be useful to have different configurations depending on your application's environment (e.g. "production" vs "development").

For instance, when developing locally it may be easier to use the `Sessions\MemoryStore` to handle session persistence while the production environment would require something more robust like `Sessions\PredisStore`. To make this configuration more explicit use `Phluid\App::configure`:

```php
<?php

$app->configure( 'production', function( $app ){
  $predis_client = use Predis\Async\Client( $host, $port );
  $app->inject( new Phluid\Middleware\Sessions( array(
    'store' => new Phluid\Middleware\PredisStore( $predis_client ),
    'secret' => 'asdfasiu38fhw998hfsoih908s'
  ) ) );
});

$app->configure( 'development', function( $app ){
  $app
    ->inject( new Phluid\Middleware\ExceptionHandler() )
    ->inject( new Phluid\Middleware\Sessions( array(
      'secret' => 'protects-sessions'
    ) ) );
});
```

By default `Phluid\App` while use `development` for it's environment but this cay be changed by using the `PHLUID_ENV` environment variable or providing the environment to the `Phluid\App::__construct` method.

## Filters

Instead of providing middleware for every request, middleware can be added to
specific routes:

```
// class AwesomeSauce implements __invoke( $request, $response, $next )
$awesome = new AwesomeSauce( 'config' );
$app->get( '/admin/', $awesome, function( $request, $response ){
  $response->renderText( 'Hello World' );
} );
// $awesome->__invoke( $req, $res, $next ) is called before the action
```
    
Passing an `array` of middlewares will execute each middleware for that route:

```
$filters = array(
  // calls RequestLogger::__invoke instance method
  new RequestLogger( "/var/log/phluid" ),
  // calls  RequestLogger::logRequest instance method
  array( new RequestLogger(), 'logRequest' ),
  // calls RequestLogger::someMethod
  array( 'RequestLogger', 'someMethod' ),
  // call logRequest() global function
  'logRequest'
);

$app->get( '/logout', $filters, function( $request, $response, $next ){
  $request->session->user = null;
  $response->renderText( "Goodbye." );
} );
```    
## Templating

Phluid comes with a pretty basic templating system. Given a route like this in
a file named `index.php`:

```
$app->get( '/', function( $req, $res ){
  $current_user = findCurrentUser();
  $res->render( 'home', array( 'user' => $current_user ) );
});
```

Phluid will look in a folder named `views` in the same directory as the
`index.php` for a file named `home.php` to use as the template. This file is
interpreted as regular old PHP with the `array` extracted into local variables
for the view:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>

</head>
<body>
  <?php echo strrev( 'dlrow olleh' ) ?>, <?php echo $user->username ?>
</body>
```
    
### Layouts
    
Templates aren't _only_ regular PHP, there's a little magic added behind
the scenes too. Each view is executed in the context of a `Phluid\ViewContext`
instance which gives you some convenient templating methods to help you
organize your content.

First off, there is the `layout` method. Let's assume you want to have all your
boilerplate HTML in one file and you just want to render the view into that
file. In your view you can call `$this->layout` to tell the templating system
which layout to render the view into. So if you change your `home.php` to:

```php
<?php $this->layout( 'public' ) ?>
<?php echo strrev( 'dlrow olleh' ) ?>, <?php echo $user->username ?>
```

The templating system will then look for a `public.php` file and render it with
the content of the `home.php` view. To make this work you need to use the
`content` template method in your layout:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>

</head>
<body>
  <?php echo $this->content() ?>
</body>
```
    
Since layouts are just views themselves, they too can have layouts.

You can also define a default layout for all `Phluid\Request::render` calls by
providing the `Phluid\App::default_layout` setting.
